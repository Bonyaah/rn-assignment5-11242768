The Settings Screen allows users to manage their preferences including changing the password, viewing the privacy policy, toggling between light and dark themes, changing the language, and contacting support.

Theme Toggle
The theme toggle feature allows users to switch between light and dark themes. The current theme is persisted across the application and can be changed from the Settings screen.

Custom Components
